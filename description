An application that will read email_id from the database and strictly send only one mail to each email_id.
when the application is run on other computer, the work should be scaled.

This application makes use of multiprocessing and multithreading with efficient use of processors,
and each thread holds session for the entire period instead of returning to pool and taking task from there,
thus minimizing the switching time, and also the session is not created again and again, thus minimizing the total time taken.
This efficiently works with great speed.
